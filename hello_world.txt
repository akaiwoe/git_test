Los' Repo
Welcome! This is a repo I have made for my initial experience working with the Git/Github workflow. I expect this to be the first of many repositories I will be working on in my future coding/software engineering career.

I pray the God continues to utilize me in a manner to uplift myself, my family, and those around me.
That he molds me into the type of person and eventually father he'd like me to be.
That he keeps my family in His grace and that my current and future family recognizes Him as their Lord and Savior.
So far Los' Repo is the first repo i have created and worked on and will primarily be where I start/build my experience and contribution's in my career.

May God Bless Me and whoever may be reading this!
